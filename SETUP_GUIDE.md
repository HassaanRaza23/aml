- ✅ Cases are created for flagged transactions

### 3. Screening
**File:** `src/pages/Screening/InstantScreening.jsx`
**Service:** `src/services/screeningService.js`

**What happens:**
- ✅ Instant screening is performed
- ✅ Ongoing screening is scheduled
- ✅ Results are stored in database
- ✅ Cases are created for matches

### 4. Case Management
**File:** `src/pages/CaseManagement/`
**Service:** `src/services/caseService.js`

**What happens:**

5. Related data saved
6. Case created if needed
7. KYC status updated
```

### Transaction Monitoring Flow:
```
1. Transaction is recorded

3. Risk score calculated using transactionRules.js
4. Alert created if flagged
5. Case created if needed
6. Audit log updated
```

### Screening Flow:
```
1. Screening is initiated
2. performInstantScreening() is called
3. External APIs are called (simulated)
4. Results are stored
5. Matches are recorded
6. Case created if matches found
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Update Your Components

#### 1. Customer Onboarding Form
```javascript
// In OnboardingForm.jsx
import { createCustomer } from '../../services/customerService'

const handleSubmit = async (formData) => {
  try {
    const customer = await createCustomer(formData)
    // Show success message
    toast.success('Customer created successfully!')
  } catch (error) {
    // Show error message
    toast.error('Failed to create customer')
  }
}
```

#### 2. Transaction Monitoring
```javascript
// In TransactionMonitoring.jsx
import { getTransactions, createTransaction } from '../../services/transactionService'

const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([])

useEffect(() => {
  const loadTransactions = async () => {
    const data = await getTransactions()
    setTransactions(data.data)
  }
  loadTransactions()
}, [])
```

#### 3. Screening
```javascript
// In InstantScreening.jsx
import { performInstantScreening } from '../../services/screeningService'

const handleScreening = async (customerId, criteria) => {
  const result = await performInstantScreening(customerId, criteria)
  // Update UI with results
}
```

## 🔐 Authentication Setup

### 1. Enable Supabase Auth
In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication → Settings
2. Enable email confirmations
3. Set up your site URL

### 2. Update Login Component
```javascript
// In LoginPage.jsx
import { supabase } from '../config/supabase'

const handleLogin = async (email, password) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email,
    password
  })
  
  if (error) {
    // Handle error
  } else {
    // Redirect to dashboard
  }
}
```

## 📊 Dashboard Integration

### 1. Real-time Statistics
```javascript
// In DashboardHome.jsx
import { getCustomerStats, getTransactionStats, getCaseStats } from '../../services'

const [stats, setStats] = useState({})

useEffect(() => {
  const loadStats = async () => {
    const customerStats = await getCustomerStats()
    const transactionStats = await getTransactionStats()
    const caseStats = await getCaseStats()
    
    setStats({
      customers: customerStats,
      transactions: transactionStats,
      cases: caseStats
    })
  }
  
  loadStats()
}, [])
```

### 2. Live Data Updates
```javascript
// Subscribe to real-time updates
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('customers')
    .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'customers' }, payload => {
      // Update UI with new data
    })
    .subscribe()

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
}, [])
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### 1. Test Customer Creation
1. Go to Customer Onboarding
2. Fill out the form
3. Submit and check database
4. Verify risk score calculation
5. Check if case was created

### 2. Test Transaction Monitoring
1. Go to Transaction Monitoring
2. Add a test transaction
3. Verify risk assessment
4. Check if alert was created

### 3. Test Screening
1. Go to Screening
2. Perform instant screening
3. Verify results are stored
4. Check if matches are recorded

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**Solution:** Check your `.env` file and ensure variables are set correctly

#### 2. "Permission denied" errors
**Solution:** Check your Supabase RLS policies and ensure they're configured correctly

#### 3. "Function not found" errors
**Solution:** Ensure all service files are imported correctly

#### 4. "Network error" when connecting to Supabase
**Solution:** Check your internet connection and Supabase project status
